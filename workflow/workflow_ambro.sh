# ASSEMBLE AMBROSIELLA TRANSCRIPTOME -------------------------------------------
## Assemble

#> If your transcriptome RNA-seq data are derived from a gene-dense compact genome, such as from fungal genomes,
#> where transcripts may often overlap in UTR regions, you can minimize fusion transcripts by leveraging the '--jaccard_clip' option if you have paired reads.
